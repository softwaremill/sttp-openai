/** @param include
  *   Additional fields to include in the response. See the include parameter for Response creation for more information.
  * @param includeObfuscation
  *   When `true`, stream obfuscation will be enabled. Stream obfuscation adds random characters to an obfuscation field on streaming delta
  *   events to normalize payload sizes as a mitigation to certain side-channel attacks. These obfuscation fields are included by default,
  *   but add a small amount of overhead to the data stream. You can set `includeObfuscation` to false to optimize for bandwidth if you
  *   trust the network links between your application and the OpenAI API.
  * @param startingAfter
  *   The sequence number of the event after which to start streaming.
  * @param stream
  *   If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using server-sent events.
